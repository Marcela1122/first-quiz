## System Security

Since I'm the head of Engineering for an exciting new tech startup that installs solar panels via an app, I'm doing a security audit of the app's infrastructure. You are using the OWASP Top 10
for 2021 as a guide for what security issues might be a problem for the startup. 

Taking into account that I have 12 software engineer employees who have full access to the system, 3 customer support employees who can view
customer information and make changes to orders and accounts, and one sales employee, this is what I look for to make the system secure:

1) **Broken Access Control:**
   - Ensure that access control mechanisms are implemented and enforced properly.
   - Use the principle of least privilege, allowing access only to authorized roles (role-based access control).
   - Limit engineers' access to only necessary resources.
   - Implement proper session management and authentication mechanisms.
   - Log access control failures and set up alerts for suspicious activities in the Solar Panel app.
   - Perform access control testing, including authorization testing.
   

2) **Cryptographic Failures:**
   - Classify sensitive data and ensure it is encrypted at rest (AES-256 encryption).
   - Use strong encryption algorithms and proper key management techniques.
   - Implement secure protocols such as TLS with forward secrecy for data in transit.
   - Avoid deprecated cryptographic functions and ensure the proper validation of cryptographic signatures.
   - Disable caching for responses containing sensitive data.
   - Store users passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing functions (bcrypt or Argon2 hashing algorithms).


3) **Injection:**
   - Implement input validation and sanitize user-supplied data.
   - Avoid using dynamic queries directly; instead, use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
   - Use secure APIs and ORMs to interact with databases.
   - Regularly perform source code reviews and automate testing for injection vulnerabilities (static and dynamic code analysis).
   - Be cautious with user-supplied data in queries, commands, or stored procedures.
   - Avoid using weak or deprecated cryptographic algorithms and ensure proper key management practices.


4) **Insecure Design**
   - Perform threat modeling specifically for the solar panel booking system to identify potential design flaws and vulnerabilities.
   - Implement secure design patterns and reference architectures to ensure robust and secure application architecture.
   - Ensure secure authentication mechanisms and proper access control to protect sensitive customer information.
   - Review and improve the credential recovery process to prevent reliance on insecure methods like "questions and answers."
   - Analyze the booking system to prevent abuse scenarios, such as bulk booking attempts that could cause financial losses to the startup.
   - Implement anti-bot design to protect against scalpers and ensure fair access to products.


5) **Security Misconfiguration**
   - Implement secure installation processes to ensure consistent, secure configurations across all environments.
   - Remove or disable unused features, components, and frameworks to minimize attack surface.
   - Ensure error handling doesn't reveal sensitive information like stack traces to users.
   - Remove sample applications with known vulnerabilities from production servers to prevent attacks.
   - Disable directory listing to prevent attackers from accessing sensitive files and source code.
   - Avoid exposing detailed error messages, which might contain sensitive information or reveal vulnerabilities.
   - Review and secure cloud storage permissions to prevent unauthorized access.


6) **Vulnerable and Outdated Components:**
   - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency Check. 
   - Continuously monitor sources like CVE and NVD for vulnerabilities.
   - Implement a patch management process to promptly address any discovered vulnerabilities.


7) **Identification and Authentication Failures:**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication for all user roles. 
   - Avoid default credentials. 
   - Enforce strong password policies following NIST guidelines. 
   - Harden registration, credential recovery, and API pathways. 
   - Limit and delay failed login attempts. 
   - Use secure, server-side session management and invalidate sessions correctly in the app.


8) **Software and Data Integrity Failures:**
   - Implement digital signatures for critical data and software components.
   - Verify software/data sources to prevent tampering. 
   - Use trusted repositories. 
   - Employ software supply chain security tools to validate integrity. 
   - Review code changes rigorously.
   - Ensure proper access control and segregation in CI/CD pipelines.


9) **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:**
   - Ensure comprehensive logging, including login attempts and high-value transactions. 
   - Use secure log formats. 
   - Encode log data correctly. 
   - Implement audit trails with integrity controls.


10) **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    - Segment remote resource access.
    - enforce "deny by default" firewall policies.
    - sanitize and validate client-supplied input data.
    - enforce URL schema/port/destination allow lists. 
    - Avoid raw responses, disable HTTP redirections, and consider network encryption for specific user groups.
